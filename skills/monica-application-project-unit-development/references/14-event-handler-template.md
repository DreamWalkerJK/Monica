# Event Handler Template

Use `$ApplicationNamespace$`, `$DomainNamespace$`, and `$ContractNamespace$` for the application, domain, and published-language namespaces selected by the architecture skill.

## Use When

- Another unit should react to an event without direct coupling to the sender.
- The reaction should complete as part of processing that event delivery.

## Rules

- Use `DomainEventHandler<TEvent>` for distributed events.
- Use `LocalEventHandler<TEvent>` for in-process reactions.
- Use the inherited `Logger` in handler methods when logging is needed. Monica resolves it after activation from the
  host that owns the handler instance; do not access it from a constructor.
- Keep handlers thin. Delegate reusable logic to `DomainService`.
- Make the event type stable before adding consumers.
- Use `$ApplicationNamespace$` for the application-layer namespace chosen by the architecture skill.
- Place handlers in `HandlersEvent/`.
- Use the [naming and boundary rules](01-project-unit-naming-and-boundaries.md) for every application consumer, including consumers marked `[Inbox]`; delivery attributes do not replace its ProjectUnit base, prefix, or metadata.
- Choose the execution boundary using [transactional events](../../monica-infra-persistence/references/transactional-events.md). Repository `IDomainEventHandler<TEvent>` handles before-commit effects in the publisher's scope; it is a different contract from these EventBus handler bases.

## Distributed Handler Example

```csharp
using Monica.ProjectUnits.Annotations;
using Monica.WebApi.Abstractions;
using $ContractNamespace$.Events;
using $DomainNamespace$.DomainServices;

namespace $ApplicationNamespace$.HandlersEvent;

[ProjectUnitMetadata(
    "Notify Warehouse After Order Approval",
    Owner = "$Owner$",
    Description = "Coordinates the warehouse reaction to an approved order.",
    Tags = ["$SubdomainTag$", "$FeatureTag$"])]
[ProjectUnitRequirement("$RequirementId$")]
public sealed class DomainEventHandlerOrderApproved(DomainNotifyWarehouse domainService)
    : DomainEventHandler<EventOrderApproved>
{
    public override async Task HandleEventAsync(
        EventOrderApproved eventData,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        await domainService.ExecuteAsync(eventData.OrderId, cancellationToken);
    }
}
```

## Local Handler Example

```csharp
using Monica.ProjectUnits.Annotations;
using Monica.WebApi.Abstractions;
using $ContractNamespace$.Events;
using $DomainNamespace$.DomainServices;

namespace $ApplicationNamespace$.HandlersEvent;

[ProjectUnitMetadata(
    "Refresh Order Read Model",
    Owner = "$Owner$",
    Description = "Refreshes the local read model after order approval.",
    Tags = ["$SubdomainTag$", "$FeatureTag$"])]
[ProjectUnitRequirement("$RequirementId$")]
public sealed class LocalEventHandlerOrderApproved(DomainRefreshReadModel domainService)
    : LocalEventHandler<EventOrderApproved>
{
    public override async Task HandleEventAsync(
        EventOrderApproved eventData,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        await domainService.ExecuteAsync(eventData.OrderId, cancellationToken);
    }
}
```

## Notes

- Keep work in the handler when it belongs to processing that delivery. Choose a [TriggeredJob](15-job-template.md) when work needs an independent execution lifecycle, such as delayed scheduling, operator control, concurrency policy, or execution history. Use [transactional events](../../monica-infra-persistence/references/transactional-events.md) for durable delivery and deduplicated receives.
- Pass the handler `CancellationToken` into every cancellable dependency. A distributed delivery timeout can return
  the message for retry, but it cannot forcibly terminate handler code that ignores cancellation.
- Do not let handlers become alternate application services with large control flow and validation logic.
