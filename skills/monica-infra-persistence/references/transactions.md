# UnitOfWork transactions

Monica's automatic UnitOfWork owns saving and commit for an operation. Register a `RepositoryDbContext<TContext>` in `DbContextProviderType.UnitOfWork` mode; [repositories](repositories.md) covers the registration, which also requires `ModuleUnitOfWork`. Resolve the handler, repositories, and participating contexts from the operation's DI scope. A database transaction requires a relational provider.

## Ordinary writes

An ordinary mediated write needs no transaction attribute. `IRepository<TEntity>.Add` and `Remove` stage changes; the automatic UnitOfWork saves them when the handler succeeds:

```csharp
using Monica.Core.Mediator;
using Monica.Core.Results;
using Monica.Repository.Persistence.Abstractions;

public sealed record SaveOrder(Order Order) : IRequest<Res>;

public sealed class SaveOrderHandler(IRepository<Order> orders)
    : IRequestHandler<SaveOrder, Res>
{
    public Task<Res> Handle(SaveOrder request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        orders.Add(request.Order);
        return Task.FromResult(Res.Ok());
    }
}
```

`Order` is the application's entity; register the handler through the host's normal DI/discovery path. The boundary begins a transaction, runs the handler, drains same-scope domain events, flushes participants, and commits. An exception, failed `Res`/`Res<T>`, or execution outcome marked for rollback rolls it back.

The execution adapters choose these defaults:

| Entry point | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Mediator handler | `Automatic`; a registered `IReadOnlyRequestConvention` selects `None` for reads, including GET-bound requests with the Web API convention |
| MVC action | `None` for GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS; `Automatic` for other HTTP methods |
| EventBus handler | `Automatic` |
| JobScheduler job | `None` |
| Seeder or hosted-service work item | `Automatic` |
| Hosted-service start/stop lifecycle | `None` |

## One declaration for an override

Use `ExecutionTransactionAttribute` from `Monica.Core.Execution` on the **concrete execution method** when its default needs to change. Request types, handler classes, and controller classes do not carry transaction metadata. The execution descriptor resolves the method declaration once; all adapters use that policy.

```csharp
using Monica.Core.Execution;

[ExecutionTransaction(ExecutionTransactionMode.None)]
public Task<Res> Handle(RefreshOrderCache request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    return cache.RefreshAsync(request.OrderId, cancellationToken);
}
```

Here `RefreshOrderCache` and `cache` are application-owned request and cache abstractions; the command updates only the cache. `None` skips Monica's automatic outer UnitOfWork, including its domain-event drain, flush, and commit. It is useful for:

- A handler that only reads, updates a cache, or calls an external service and has no local database changes to commit.
- An orchestrator such as an import where each item must commit independently and partial success is acceptable. Mark the outer method `None`, create a fresh DI scope per item, and send each ordinary write through that scope's mediator. Earlier committed items remain committed when a later item fails.

`None` does not suspend an enclosing transaction or prevent writes. A nested operation in the same scope can still use its caller's transaction. A staged repository change in a standalone `None` operation is not automatically saved; keep ordinary database commands on `Automatic`. Disabling the boundary for performance also removes its consistency and save behavior; measure any benefit against the operation's requirements.

To opt a default-`None` method into automatic saving, apply `[ExecutionTransaction(ExecutionTransactionMode.Automatic)]` to that method. This still requires UnitOfWork registration and participating contexts.

## Select database participants

When one UnitOfWork context is registered, it is selected automatically. With multiple write contexts, the same method declaration must select participants:

```csharp
[ExecutionTransaction(
    ExecutionTransactionMode.Automatic,
    DbContextTypes = new[] { typeof(OrdersDbContext), typeof(OrderProjectionDbContext) })]
public Task<Res> Handle(ApproveOrder request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    // Stage the application's order and projection changes here.
    return Task.FromResult(Res.Ok());
}
```

The application owns these context and request types. Types must be distinct registered `DbContext` types. The first context owns the physical transaction and any Inbox/Outbox rows; additional participants must share the **same `DbConnection` instance** and relational provider. Independent databases cannot form this local transaction. An empty selection uses the registered-context default. `None` rejects an explicit nonempty context selection.

## Explicit callers and scope lifetime

For work outside an execution adapter, resolve `IUnitOfWorkManager` and the repository from the **same scope** and use the same transaction engine explicitly:

```csharp
await unitOfWork.RunAsync(() =>
{
    repository.Add(order);
    return Task.CompletedTask;
}, cancellationToken: cancellationToken);
```

Supply `UnitOfWorkScopeOptions(DbContextTypes: [typeof(OrdersDbContext)])` when an explicit caller needs context selection. `UnitOfWorkScopeOptions` also supplies isolation and command-timeout settings. A pipeline caller's explicit execution feature takes precedence over the method's context selection.

A nested `RunAsync` joins the active transaction; even a caught nested failure leaves the outer operation rollback-only. The manager becomes terminal after completion or failure, so retry or verify committed state in a fresh DI scope. `Current.FlushAsync()` and direct `SaveChangesAsync()` flush changes inside the active transaction; neither commits it. A failed save faults the context. `SaveChanges(false)` and concurrent/recursive saves are unsupported. For durable delivery within this boundary, read [transactional events](transactional-events.md).

Policy declaration and resolution: `Monica.Core/Execution/ExecutionTransactionAttribute.cs` and `ExecutionDescriptor.cs`. Transaction semantics: `Monica.Repository/UnitOfWork/Services/UnitOfWorkManager.cs` and `Services/Behaviors/UnitOfWorkExecutionBehavior.cs`. `tests/Test.Monica.Repository/UnitOfWork/UnitOfWorkRepositoryCommitTests.cs`, `UnitOfWorkExecutionBehaviorTests.cs`, and `SharedTransactionTests.cs` exercise saving, rollback, and shared-connection boundaries.
