# Monica Application Unit Testing

Test business behavior through a complete Monica host when composition matters. Each scenario owns its host and database; registrations are finalized before build. Arrange, act and assert use independent scopes.

## Repository Test Infrastructure First

Search the repository's shared test layer (for example Platform.UnitTests or PlatformTestApplicationFactory) before writing a factory. Extend existing project infrastructure when it covers the scenario. Do not introduce another framework with different transaction semantics.

## Workflow

1. Inspect production startup, module registration, discovery assemblies, contexts, external adapters and existing test factories.
2. Use a runnable project named Test. plus the exact production project stem.
3. Derive a stateless project recipe from MonicaTestApplicationFactory<TDiscoveryAnchor>:
   - ConfigureMonica composes the relevant production module graph.
   - TypeDiscoveryAssemblies includes all production assemblies needed by the scenario.
   - ConfigureHost supplies host/environment inputs.
   - ConfigureServices applies stable boundary replacements before build; call its base implementation.
4. Call CreateAsync for each scenario. Its optional ISeamReplacementBuilder callback applies scenario-specific replacements before build.
5. Arrange with application.SeedAsync<TContext,TResult>, execute with application.ExecuteAsync, and verify with application.VerifyAsync<TContext>.
6. Assert business outcomes, persisted state and durable notifications separately from delivery.
7. Dispose the application and run the target test project.

## Write and Read Boundaries

Use `$monica-infra-persistence` for the current repository and UnitOfWork contracts; this section identifies the test boundary those contracts require.

- IRepository<TEntity> exposes Add/Remove; keyed repositories load tracked aggregates with FindAsync/GetAsync. Mutate the loaded instance. No detached Update or repository save is required.
- application.ExecuteAsync creates a fresh scope and calls the production IExecutionPipeline. Resolve the handler inside its callback. Exceptions, cancellation and failed Monica result envelopes roll back; an early FlushAsync or direct context save stays inside that transaction.
- AddRepositoryDbContext defaults to UnitOfWork participation and enables the module. Independently managed infrastructure stores explicitly use Default. Multiple business contexts require explicit operation selection.
- Completed/faulted operation scopes are terminal. Each retry or independent operation gets a fresh scope. A caught nested failure still prevents commit.
- For mediator-specific behavior, resolve IMediator in a fresh scope and Send the actual request. GET-bound query requests are read-only by convention and avoid an automatic write transaction.
- For direct read-only calls, use application.CreateScope and resolve the service there. Direct resolution alone does not invoke the pipeline.
- Native EF queries stay in infrastructure; business query interfaces return materialized projections. Do not enumerate an IQueryable after its scope is disposed.

## Arrange and Verify

application.SeedAsync<TContext,TResult> takes a typed context callback. Add a heterogeneous graph together, call db.SaveChangesAsync inside the callback, and return keys or DTOs. An unsaved callback fails visibly.

Each seed callback and VerifyAsync callback uses a fresh scope. Data remains in the scenario database across these scopes. Pass foreign keys or load existing parents when arranging later data; do not pass detached seed graphs into the act phase.

Do not initialize contexts manually, clear trackers to make writes pass, or reconstruct transaction behavior in test helpers.

## Database and Audit

UseTestDatabase<TContext>() overrides provider options while preserving production context/provider registrations. It requires production AddRepositoryDbContext first. One named SQLite memory database is owned by each scenario/context type, with independent scoped connections. Optional configureOptions supplies necessary EF interceptors/options.

UseRealTestDatabase<TContext> for production-provider SQL, isolation and sharding tests. The caller owns schema/data isolation and cleanup. SQLite does not establish those guarantees.

Default seams retain the real audit policy. Replace ICurrentUser, TimeProvider and ID generators when deterministic inputs are needed; do not replace audit logic with a no-op.

## Event Assertions

- Explicit domain effects use IDomainEventQueue and same-scope IDomainEventHandler handlers before commit.
- Committed notifications/integration events use ordinary `[Outbox]` EventBus payloads. Inspect persisted JSON snapshots before delivery.
- Call application.DrainOutboxAsync<TContext> explicitly to test delivery. Keep the scoped bus gateway and replace `IEventTransport` with a recording double.
- Delivery is at least once. Exercise a failure after receipt but before acknowledgment and assert stable message identity and optional `[Inbox]` consumer deduplication.
- Do not restore pre-commit transport publishing or sleeps to wait for an uncontrolled dispatcher.

## Ownership and Naming

- Project, folder, assembly and root namespace: Test.{ProductionProjectName}.
- Factory: {Service}TestApplicationFactory; field: _factory.
- Classes: {TypeUnderTest}Tests; methods: Method_WhenCondition_ShouldExpectation.
- Mirror production folders such as HandlersCommand, HandlersQuery, DomainServices, Repositories, Entities and Modules.
- Keep Builders, TestDoubles, TestData and Factories test-only.
- Do not cache an application/provider on a reusable factory.
- A built service provider is immutable. CreateScope never replaces registrations.
- Never share a MonicaApplication across root providers.
- Independent scenarios run in parallel. Serialize only a named real external resource that cannot be isolated.

## Requirement and Unit Traits

- Declare the governing requirement once per test class with `[Trait("REQ", "<requirement-id>")]`; add a method-level REQ trait only when one test exercises an additional requirement.
- Add `[Trait("Unit", "<runtimeKey>")]` — the namespace-qualified type name of the unit under test — when the `{TypeUnderTest}Tests` name is absent or its stem names more than one unit. A class carrying Unit traits is linked only through them; a class without them falls back to the naming convention.
- `REQ` and `Unit` are the reserved trait keys for requirement and unit linkage: `dotnet test --filter "REQ=<requirement-id>"` runs exactly the covering slice, trait values flow into JUnit XML for CI cross-checks, and Test Explorer groups tests by requirement.
- Trait arguments must be constant, non-empty strings; other trait keys stay free for repository-local tooling.

## Smaller Boundaries

Use raw ProjectUnitFixture<TUnit> only when collaborators are explicit and composition, discovery, proxies, transactions, hosted lifecycle and host ownership are outside the assertion. It does not supply a substitute production UoW. Entity/value-object invariant tests may construct objects directly.

Replace external boundaries, not domain services, repositories or policy logic. Avoid uncontrolled network/database access and hidden machine dependencies. Keep assertions in tests.

## References and Validation

Read references/standards.md for layout and ownership, references/templates.md for exact API examples, and references/database-isolation.md for provider choices.

Run the relevant test project using the repository's verification policy and paths understood by the selected SDK. Keep build/test processes sharing outputs sequential and resolve all build warnings.
